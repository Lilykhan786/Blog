Repl.it #weekly 12, blog

Last weekly, A simple blog about my experience in repl.it discord server so far.

#### Details
Tbh I don't have much details to give about it, as you can see and read its just a simple blog about my experience but I think its an interesting read, everything is real and kinda funny for me. I didn't write about everyone in this blog coz there are so many people I know and I like to talk with in replit server but I tried my best to mention all the active and nice people of the community.
